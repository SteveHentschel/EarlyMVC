Working thru the tutorial "Getting Started with EF5 using MVC4, Creating an Entity Framework Data Model" by
Tom Dykstra on MS' asp.net site.

Jan 17, Rev 1.1 - Sections 2 and 3 today.  This tutorial is very comprehensive, covers a lot of topics. 
Learned more about ViewModels in Sect 3, will have to try again with those in FunWithDBs.  slh

Jan 16, Rev 1.0 - Just did section 1 of 10 today.  Had to start over as I inadvertently created the project with 
.NET 4.0 instead of 4.5 or 4.5.1, and the IEnumerable Grade in Enrollments was not being written to the DB.  Fun.  slh
