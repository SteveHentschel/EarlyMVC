Another MS tutorial: "EF Database First with ASP.NET MVC" by Tom FitzMacken on MS' asp.net site.
This one I'm using MVC5 with .NET 4.5.1 and Entity Framework 6.0


Jan 30, Rev 1.0 - Went thru sections 1-3 of 6 today.  Not such an advanced tutorial, but it does give a good feel 
for MVC5 and the comsmetic differences.  Just doing a subset of the full Contoso.  Will finish tomorrow.  slh
